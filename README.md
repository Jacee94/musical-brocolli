## About National Mapper
We wanted an application that made it easy to look up information about various National Parks in specific states or provinces. The plan was simple,
* Type a two letter identifier and show National Parks
* Have a description about the park
* Have a picture from the park
* Have a clickable link that takes you to a map of said park.

## How we accomplished this
We used a few new to us technologies that included a new CSS framework and two different server side API's that are called upon.
*  CSS Framework: https://picocss.com/
* National Park Service: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm
* National Map: https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/there-api-accessing-national-map-data
